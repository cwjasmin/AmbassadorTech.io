# Ambassadors Tech Program
Guardar
Introduction
The Web3 sector has experienced significant growth, highlighting the importance of virtual communities for the development and adoption of new technologies such as NFTs, DeFi protocols, DAOs, and blockchain networks. These communities not only provide spaces for connection where participants share values and work towards common goals, but they are also essential in driving a decentralized digital ecosystem, promoting mass user adoption, and evolving the web into a more autonomous and secure environment.

With a variety of platforms like Discord and Telegram, participants can find and join communities aligned with their interests, contributing to the growth of this booming industry. This phenomenon has created the need for new profiles and roles that are crucial to its operation and success.

Among these roles are community moderators, who ensure rule compliance and foster a positive environment; blockchain developers, who build and maintain the technical infrastructure; content strategists, who create relevant material to maintain members' interest and participation; and opinion leaders, who guide discussions and trends within the community with their influence and knowledge. In addition, project managers and engagement specialists are critical in coordinating efforts and keeping users active and engaged. These roles reflect the diversity and complexity of today's virtual communities, showcasing the dynamism and innovation that characterize the Web3 sector.

In particular, ambassadors of Web3 virtual communities play a fundamental role. They act as representatives and promoters of the brand or project both inside and outside the community. Selected for their enthusiasm and knowledge in the area, they are responsible for spreading the project's vision and values, attracting and guiding new members, and serving as key points of contact to gather feedback and suggestions that are vital for the ongoing development of the project. Their ability to build strong relationships and influence within the community is essential for fostering collaboration and mutual support, contributing to the organic and sustainable growth of the community.

Problem Identification
The lack of automated systems to measure ambassador performance in Web3 projects represents a significant limitation, affecting several critical aspects of community development and management in this emerging sector. Below are the specific challenges associated with this issue:

Inaccurate Performance Evaluation

Lack of Reliable Data:
Relying on manual methods to collect data leads to errors and inconsistencies, making it difficult to accurately assess ambassador performance.
Subjectivity in Evaluation:
The absence of objective metrics leads to subjective evaluations, affecting morale and creating distrust.
Inefficient Resource Management

Excessive Time and Effort:
Manual management of reports and evaluation of activities consumes significant time and resources that could be better used in other critical areas of the project.
Difficulty Scaling:
As communities grow, manual management becomes unsustainable. The lack of automation prevents efficient scaling, limiting the ability to attract and manage a larger number of ambassadors.
Negative Impact on Marketing Strategy

Ineffective Strategies:
Without accurate data on ambassador performance, it's challenging to adjust and improve marketing strategies.
Difficulty Motivating and Retaining Ambassadors

Inadequate Incentives:
The lack of an automated system hinders the implementation of fair incentive programs.
High Turnover Rate:
A lack of proper recognition can lead to high ambassador turnover.
Lack of Transparency and Credibility

Community Distrust:
Without a transparent and automated system for measuring performance, community members may doubt the fairness and impartiality of ambassador evaluations, eroding trust and credibility.
Limitations in Data-Driven Decision Making

Lack of Actionable Insights:
Without automated systems, it's difficult to gain actionable insights into ambassador behavior and contributions, hindering informed and timely decision-making to improve community management.
Value Proposition
An automated tracking system will allow monitoring of key performance indicators (KPIs) such as engagement, brand reach, and sales conversions. This will provide valuable feedback on the contribution to the project, helping to identify areas for improvement and recognize the ambassadors' efforts.

Blockchain technology offers transparency and immutability, allowing the actions and contributions of ambassadors to be tracked and verified securely. The implementation of smart contracts can automate ambassador performance evaluations, linking their rewards to achieved milestones.

Name: AmbassadorSocialTech.io
Audience
Our audience includes:

Web2 and Web3 Project Ambassadors: Individuals already serving as ambassadors in digital projects looking for tools to improve their performance and visibility.
Web2 and Web3 Community Leaders: Responsible for managing and growing digital communities, interested in implementing an efficient, transparent, and secure management system for their brand ambassadors.
Web3 Project Managers: Professionals seeking blockchain-based solutions to improve transparency and efficiency in community management.
Project Objective
Create AmbassadorSocialTech.io, a comprehensive platform that centralizes resources and information for brand ambassadors in the Web3 space. The goal is to empower both social and technical ambassadors by providing them with the tools they need to maximize their impact and effectiveness.

Our proposal leverages the incentive mechanisms proposed by Vottun in their white paper, summarized below:

Vottun’s Incentives for Developers:
To encourage developers ("ARCHITECTS") to build dApps on the Vottun platform, the following mechanisms have been established:

Staking Rewards:
ARCHITECTS must stake a certain amount of VTN tokens to receive rewards for their dApps, with the percentage of reward varying by level:
Level 1: 60,000 VTN for 100% rewards.
Level 2: 35,000 VTN for 75% rewards.
Level 3: 12,000 VTN for 40% rewards.
Service Fee Distribution:
When a dApp is used, a service fee is applied, distributed as follows:
70% to the ARCHITECT.
20% to the platform treasury for ecosystem development.
The remainder to a B2E (Build to Earn) reserve to support future incentives and platform growth.
Education and Support:
Vottun will provide educational materials, video tutorials, and technical support to help ARCHITECTS successfully develop and deploy their dApps.
This system will be applied to AmbassadorSocialTech.io with Vottun’s program, leaving the possibility open for the team to adapt this service to any project or startup within the Web3 ecosystem.
